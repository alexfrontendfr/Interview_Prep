        "question": "How would you optimize a landing page built with React to reduce load time and improve SEO?",
        "options": [
            "Use client-side rendering and larger image sizes",
            "Implement server-side rendering, lazy loading, and smaller bundles",
            "Increase the size of JavaScript bundles and use animations",
            "Disable caching to ensure every load is fresh"
        ],
        "answer": 1,
        "explanation": "To optimize a React landing page, server-side rendering (SSR) can improve SEO, while lazy loading and code-splitting help reduce initial load times. Reducing JavaScript bundle size further boosts performance."

        "question": "How would you set up A/B testing for a Next.js application\u2019s user interface?",
        "options": [
            "Manually switch between variations on your localhost",
            "Use a split-testing library like react-ab-test and set up different variations",
            "Create two separate apps and manually check user interactions",
            "Make variations randomly visible to users without tracking"
        ],
        "answer": 1,
        "explanation": "To set up A/B testing in Next.js, libraries like react-ab-test help define UI component variations. These are tested by splitting traffic and measuring the success of each variation through analytics tools."

        "question": "How would you handle global state management in a large Next.js application?",
        "options": [
            "Directly pass props to every component",
            "Use Redux or Context API for global state management",
            "Store global state in localStorage only",
            "Avoid state management and rely solely on API calls"
        ],
        "answer": 1,
        "explanation": "In large Next.js apps, global state management can be efficiently handled using Redux or the Context API. This ensures that state changes only affect necessary components, preventing excessive re-renders."

            "Use any for every type to avoid errors",
            "Use async/await along with proper type annotations",
            "Avoid using types altogether for async functions",
            "Handle errors by ignoring type definitions"
        ],
        "answer": 1,
        "explanation": "In TypeScript, using async/await along with proper type annotations ensures type safety. You define types for request parameters and response objects to maintain consistent, predictable results."

        "options": [
            "SSR is not useful in Next.js",
            "SSR improves SEO by rendering pages server-side and is implemented using getServerSideProps",
            "SSR only works for static websites",
            "SSR allows pages to load slower but ensures they're up to date"
        ],
        "answer": 1,
        "explanation": "In Next.js, SSR improves SEO by rendering HTML on the server before sending it to the client. This makes pages easier for search engines to index and improves the initial page load experience for users."
